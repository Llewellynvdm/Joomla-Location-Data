Where do we get IP and Exchange Rate Updates?
---------------------
* The database used to update the IP tables is provided by [software77.net](http://software77.net/geo-ip/) as [donationware](http://software77.net/geo-ip/?license). They need your support! Please make a [donation via paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=3HKM8N5XXUHV6) now!
* [Yahoo finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter/) is used to update the exchange rates.
* [Vast Development Method](https://github.com/ExchangeRates) [Build a bash script](https://github.com/ExchangeRates/Factory) that runs 24/7 on there own in house servers that updates a [gitHub repository](https://github.com/ExchangeRates/yahoo) with the latest exchange rates form Yahoo. Location Data then pulls the rates from there. The reason being that updating 24 000 exchange rates takes nearly 30 minutes and doing that on a shared hosting environment on a regular bases will cause issues. So now it takes only 20 seconds to update all 26 000 exchange rates, and you can do it more regularly to insure accuracy.
* You can move this [bash script](https://github.com/ExchangeRates/Factory) to our own server and point Location Data to get its exchange rates from your own git repository, so you are totally in control.

Updates are free!
---------------------
* Always use the [latest version](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Location-Data/zipball/master/).
